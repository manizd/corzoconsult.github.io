                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Good morning once again. So appreciated to be here on Sunday.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Tawana:</b> All right. You know what? Half the year is gone.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Oh, my God, yes.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Tawana:</b> I know. You hate to look at it that way, but half the year is gone already, and we still are preparing for so many different things, as we are … as my husband says, rapidly, he’s getting to 60. I’m just in my mid-50s, so, but there are things that we just have to get in place here, for our retirement. For impending death, because we all got to die, okay?
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Right. Of course.

We’re experiencing so much, in terms of good things these days. We have self-employment. We’re back to work.

                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Yes. Term insurance. Term life insurance. You hear about it on TV. A lot of commercials. Some people talk about whole life, but term insurance what we cliche as the cheap insurance. Insurance, life insurance is all still about planning something in the future. But understand, term insurance is just to cover loss of income, or to cover assets that you need to be paid, just in case of a tragic loss.
                                        <br><br>

                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Tawana:</b> So if I have a 30-year policy in term life, and I’m not dead at that time, I have not passed on, so I can renew that. But you’re saying that the prices will probably be different, way different. Okay.

                                        <br><br>

Yeah, it’s definitely something that we have to look at, but it’s just set objectively for covering loss of income. It has very little other strategic benefit, unlike some of the others that we’ll talk about.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Tawana:</b> Okay. So let’s go right into whole life insurance. That’s something else that we’re seeing a lot of, on television. You see these older people talking about whole life insurance. Is that for seniors? Or is that for anybody?

                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> The kind of commercials you see on TV are pretty slated towards lower face value policies, maybe up to $25,000. A lot of times they’re geared towards people who waited later in life, who don’t have life insurance, and they didn’t plan early. And so, you get these policies to make sure that your end of life services or celebration is covered, that you don’t leave any bills for your children or for your loved ones.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> But whole life in itself can be a strategic plan, if we pay attention to it. It has its own tax code, 7702, and it has provisions that can be put in place, if you strategize with your agent, so that you can use it throughout your entire life for different things. If it’s done properly, [Tawana 00:</b>06:</b>12], even the death benefit grows over time. So we have to be able to look at it from a very strategic perspective, not just from a product, and it’s more expensive, and term life is cheap.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> But from a strategic perspective, and have a clear discussion as to, what would you like it to look it in the future, when there’s potentially time for you to use it while you’re living? Because a lot of these policies also have accelerated death benefits, so if you’re ever chronically ill, critically ill or terminally ill, you can pull some of the money down off the policy while you’re living, to help you with healthcare costs. So it’s very important to strategize and potentially look at this extremely earlier in life.
                                        <br><br>

You know, the general business insurance is purchased through your property and casualty companies, your regular companies that do auto and homeowner’s. But life insurance agents provide what is called, the two main ones that I know of are called key man insurance, or buy-sell agreements. Both have to do with the principals in the company.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Key man is just what it says. If there’s a key employee, maybe a great salesperson’s who bringing in the majority of your revenue, maybe a person who manages all your operations, and you may be an absentee business owner, but the business is going extremely well, key man insurance gives you the ability to have life insurance on that person, just in case something happens to that person. So you can continue with business continuity.

So this way, things are already in place, because, as I tell people, insurance is about planning and strategizing for choices and options in the future. This way, you’re in, you’re putting yourself in a position where you’re covered either way. Because, like you said in the beginning, our health will decline, and at some point, we have to go.
