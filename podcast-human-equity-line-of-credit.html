                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Good morning and thank you for joining us. I’m Twanda Black, and joining me this morning our Chief Wealth Strategist, Steven LaBroi, CEO of the LaBroi Insurance Group, and now new author. He’s just finished his book, Build Your Human Equity Line of Credit: the secrets to creating a lifetime of assets in any economy. Congratulations, Steven.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Man, I so much appreciate it. It’s been a long time coming, and I am super excited.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> I know.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Super excited.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> I know, and just probably the world off your shoulders to have it finished, you know?
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Yes.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Just finished, yay. And they can get a copy tomorrow, starting tomorrow, right?
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Yes. Yes. Amazon is ready to ship the 22nd. And we’ll have it on other platforms as well. So, if you don’t find it in your area, in your library or your bookstore, ask for it or send us an email and we will make sure that that happens.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Okay. All right. So, we decided to talk about the book, Build Your Human Equity Line of Credit. And we’ve been talking about this, the HELOC for a minute, probably over a year here and there we’ve hit it. But we’re going to talk about what that is. What is a human equity line of credit? Let’s start right there.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Okay. You know, this is a trademarked term. You know, I ironically came up with this one day just, you know how ideas hit you real hard, and I thought about it. I said, “We’re human, and we want to have a line of credit for the rest of our lives. So, what I consider it is is a focus, a strategy, a plan to create a safe source of funds operating as a foundation, financial foundation for you throughout your life that can be part of the nucleus of how you live, invest, and win. We use some base tools that benefit you the most. So, we create something for you in terms of a strategy that will provide assets and net worth. So, our human equity line of credit, versus what some people think of, home equity line.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> And you start by saying we ourselves are actually the collateral. Talk about that. Some of us may think we don’t have anything. How are we going to be the collateral?
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Interesting enough, it all began thinking about assets. And I found a quote that I thought fit very appropriately. Tom Hopkins, who I followed in my sales career, an international sales and management trainer said, “You are your greatest asset. Put your time effort and money into training, grooming, and encouraging your greatest asset.” I just love that because it just tells me that I can focus on me without being concerned about the world around. So, as collateral, you’re your biggest asset. You go out every day to turn your time into income based on what you know or what you learn. And that can create an asset for you, but you’re the asset that does that. So, your health, your energy, the older you get the wiser you are, sometimes the younger you are the more you know. And with specific tools you can just continue to grow it. And we will help you try and figure out this whole human equity line of credit process to make it very, very important for your.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Building guaranteed savings towards current and future spending. You talk about savings, you’re talking about … Wow, a lot of people are like, “I can’t save anything.” And then some folks say, “Hey, you’re supposed to have three to six months of everything, all of your wealth in case something happens. In case you lose your job or you have a medical issue, all of that.” And it’s so hard to save.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> My god. This is something that a lot of people cringe on because inflation. I mean, seriously, you know? Inflation and the prices go up and you hear on TV about interest rates going up. And a lot of that is macro economics, but at the end of the day, we have to control our own personal position. So, when they say three to six months or some people even say 12 months, you know? These are theories, but very few people show you how to do it. I used to hear that from my grandmother all the time, “Put a little back.” Put a little back every check. You know? But she never really told me how to do it, but you just had to have discipline.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Yes.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> You know?
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Yes.
                                        <br><br>

You can think of things that you’re going to need in the future. You can think of people put together vision boards on things that they want. And everything on that vision board in most instances costs money. So, the idea is to be able to build assets that can support it for future needs. I mean, there’s … you can always decide, “I’m going to make more income.” But in most instances, someone else is in charge of that decision. The idea is if you build enough assets, those assets will help yield the income for the things that you’re thinking about, dreaming about, knowing that you’re going to need, even if it’s planning for college for your children, planning for a new home, knowing you’re going to need another car some time in the future. I mean, those are practical things. But at the end of the day, if we can plan for it using the money that we currently have by creating some assets that are available to us that we may not know about and strategy, then those kinds of things would be materialized pretty easily. So, I’m excited about sharing this information and it’s important.

                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Yeah. Sidebar here, yesterday I read that insurance companies bank on people not knowing that they’re beneficiaries, and that they really don’t look for you if they can’t find you right there, if you moved or whatever, and they hold onto that money. I read that story, and I was like, “You know what?” And so, there are a lot of people out there who have money who have been beneficiaries and have no idea that they have money. But I say it to say that we talk about legacy there, you’ve got to let folks know that you’re leaving them something so that they will know in your passing to look for something or to go wherever they need to go, you know? You need to let folks know.

But at the end of the day, I’m going to give brass facts, an insurance policy is a contract. There’s always two people on a contract. And so, we have to, as you say it, put as much information on that contract of the beneficiary that we can. So, security, birth date, address, phone number, so that it is available. And the courts are also starting to pay attention to that because insurance companies do have some level of responsibility. But the responsibility is on us.

But they charge you more based on the products that you want or that you need, like loans. If we can reproduce that process for ourselves.

It’s about duplicating the process so that you become the winner in terms of earning interest on the money that you put away, and being able to loan money or borrow money and use it to make more money. So, it’s a unique little process, the strategies are out there and have been out there for 50 years.

And again, it’s kind of like saving, very difficult. Sometimes we can’t wrap our brain around, “How do I eliminate that debt?” But it takes such sacrifice on both parts on saving and eliminating debt.

We’ve been kind of put in a position in our country where financing everything we do is one of the preferred options. But if we learn a couple of other strategies, we can eliminate debt, build wealth, those assets that we talked about earlier, and do it simultaneously and control the debt that we use making better choice. You know, cleaning the debt off is a very important step. But I don’t want us to get to a point where … I know this is where I used to be. I’d pay off all my credit cards, and then I figured I had more money to spend.

When you have a lot of debt, you can’t breathe because you’re trying to figure that thing out, but you’ve got to live. And it’s a vicious cycle, like you said, of, “I owe.” And the more credit I have, the more I owe. And it’s a vicious cycle. And one of the biggest things that you talk about is retirement. We have more baby boomers than ever, than any population in the world right now. So, everybody’s moving toward retirement and even if you’re not a baby boomer you’re still going to be moving toward retirement. And you need to figure that out, how do you want to live in your retirement? And think about the important things that go along with that. There could be medical issues, you may not have the same lifestyle. How do you want to live in your retirement?

                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> My god. I mean, here’s the thing. And I’ve always said this. Everybody is changing the definition of retirement. I hear people tell me they’ll never retire. I get people telling me retirement’s not an option for them. The idea is that, to me, there’s three things. There’s either health, there’s age, or there’s an employer who actually has a hand in your minimizing or even eliminating the opportunity to go and get income. So, retirement is not an absolute. It’s a factor of one of these particular things. What we want to do is try to create an opportunity for you to have in mind where and how and what do you plan on doing for cashflow in retirement, or at that time in which income is not coming to you. It’s what they call distribution years.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> So, we have accumulation years all the way through to that particular timeframe, and then we’re distribution years so that we’re using the money we’ve accumulated at the time in which we decide or someone decides for us or our health, that income is not going to be coming in at the same rate that it had in the past. So, we use these tools to try to help you create some guarantees and some absolutes to know exactly what you’re going to have coming in so you can make the proper adjustments, whether it be upsize, downsize, whatever it is you need. Yep.

                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Right.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> So, don’t be afraid to pass on that information generationally because our children need to know. We need to know. We need to know.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Yes. A buddy of mine gathered his kids and nieces and nephews who are in their 20s. And he calls them an all star team. And he has a conference call with them once a quarter to talk to them about things that he knows. And these young adults, I should say, I apologize. They’re in their 20s and approaching 30. And he’s downloading things that he’s been exposed to. We have to go back to sharing information. We have to.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Yes. Everybody doesn’t know everything. We know the kids think they know it all. But when you start talking to them about lifestyle and how they want to live, and how they want to live in the future, how they’re going to take care of those kids and college, they listen. So, we need to begin to do that. If we’re not already doing it, we really need to begin to talk with them. Don’t worry about the ones that don’t want to listen yet. When they see the other ones doing well, they’re going to start. They’ll get on the bandwagon.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> That’s right.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> They will get on the bandwagon. LaBroi, tell everybody how they can get the book out tomorrow. I’m so excited.
