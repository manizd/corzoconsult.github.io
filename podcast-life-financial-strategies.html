                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Good morning, thanks for coming back to the show. I’m [Twanda Black 00:</b>00:</b>02], and joining me this morning our chief strategist Steven LaBroi of the LaBroi Insurance Group LLC, and executive director of the Millennial Banking Concept, a not-for-profit organization objective to help young adults through money management strategies.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> How are you this morning?
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Well, I’m great, I’m great. Another beautiful Sunday morning, and I’m just really happy and pleased to be here.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Absolutely. We’re going to talk about our millennial generation. We talk a lot about millennials, and discuss a work plan that can help them get ahead and stay ahead during their lifetime. There are certain things that I think has to be a realization for millennials, right?
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah. The idea that we discuss is mostly looking at things from a long view, even paying attention to the things that happen every day that will focus on what’s going to make your future and how to make a living, so it’s really important to be proactive and not react to everything that’s coming.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Yean, yeah, very interesting. I got a chance to spend a couple of weeks with my millennial son over in Australia, and just listening to him, very interesting. Very interesting take on life, on the government and how they want to do things, and I kind of agree with … well, I do agree with you that regardless of all of that, you still have to live, you still have to have lights and a home, and if you marry, you have children, you have to be able to take care of those kids, you still have life’s issues, all the things that go along with making a life a life.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Yes, yes. Millennials are just another generation that is characterized by the media or groups of folks that do this kind of characterization. But I tell you what, no matter what, we’re moving through life at the same trajectory, there are just a few different things that may occur that has happened as we’ve grown, like cellphones and computers and-
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Technology, period, yeah.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> … and iPads. All that stuff is in play, but we have to still work through it.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Now, when they talk about the millennial generation, they say that this is a generation that will inherit the baby boomers’ stuff, whatever you left, the legacy, whatever you left, and most of us will make sure or we’re making sure that we leave something to our children.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Well, I tell you what, it’s a part of a plan that is already inherent in generations past. It’s designed that way. We should live our lives in a way in which we’re able to take advantage of what’s happening here, create a better place, and then move things along to our children and grandchildren. As they matriculate, we want them to have good lives as well, so this is a part of a plan that we have to sit down and take some very care and look at. As opposed to just trying to live day-to-day, we have to be proactive and take a look at these things clearly.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Absolutely, and no matter what’s going on, we’re all going through it together. It’s not like, oh, the millennials over here and they have their issues, and we’re over here and we have … No! We’re going through this thing all together.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Yes, yes. You think about we’re still exposed to personal challenges, we still all have to create goals, we still all have to meet objectives. You’ll be driven by things that you see, you hear, things you don’t see like the economy, the weather, culture, national and international influences, and obviously technology is going to be a major influence on our lives.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> So, let’s talk about, for a moment, what some of our millennial children are going through like financial planning, credit cards, paying back student loans. Those are serious issues.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> Yes. When you think about this, most of us face having to finance the things that we need upfront, primarily because of the cost, then cost continue to rise day-to-day, year-to-year, and that’s what these institutions are out here doing. They’re financing things for us. Well, they’re making money on interest.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Steven LaBroi:</b> But at the same time, we have to get a concerted plan to pay these things off and still create a life for ourselves, still build wealth and still create assets. So, it’s very strategic on how we look at the things that we borrow so that we can also manage our lives simultaneously.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Twanda Black:</b> Yeah, I’m looking at going back to school for a master’s and that’s $15,000 out of your budget, and so where does that money come from? Is it out of your everyday living budget, or do you have that money set aside? It’s the same for a millennial or anybody else that’s trying to go to school without the benefit of having any scholarship or money or anything like that.
                                        <br><br>

Wealth is building wealth and how many days can you live without going out and finding a job or having to have someone pay you? That means we have to put something away, we have to accumulate enough so that when it’s distributed to us it manages the rest of our lives as well as the expenses that we’ll continue to have.
